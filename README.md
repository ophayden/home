# vhome - the virtual home package

Use the same bash environment everywhere.

## How to install

Fork the repository and make your customizations in home.skel. Then run the
following:

```
git clone {your forked repo}
./install
{check diffs and that it's what you want}
./install force
```

Move the vhome git repo folder to ~/.vhome so you don't have to clone it
everytime you update the template.
